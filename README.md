# Advising-Application
 For this course's projects, the problem i was trying to solve was how to organize data. 
 Specifically, Course data for "ABC" university. 
 I approached the problem from the "KISS" (keep it simple, stuipd) mindset, Given the relatively small amount of data that would need to be handled by the program i decided upon a vector over other data structes, as it would be the simplest to implement. 
 Had the program needed to handle larger amounts of data, i would have gone with the simplest to implement in that case, a linked list in my opinion.
The main roadblock I struggled with for the activities in this course was my lack of experience reading other people's code.
Over time, and with some practice, I got used to this.
This project helped me to take into consideration the types of data structers used and their impact on program performance Before this course, I would have put everything into either vectors or lists, now i know how to build appropriate data structures to suit the task at hand.
